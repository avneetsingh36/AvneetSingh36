# Hello, I'm Avneet Singh 

I'm a Computer Science student currently in my senior year at the University of Pittsburgh. I'm passionate about delving into the intricacies of low-level programming and system security, continually aiming to understand how things work behind the scenes.

Currently, I'm devoting my efforts towards building a robust password manager, [SecuredStringsOSI](https://github.com/avneetsingh36/SecuredStringsOSI). I enjoy the challenge of creating secure software that can stand up to the ever-evolving landscape of threats we face in today's digital world.

I'm always interested in expanding my knowledge and taking on new, exciting projects. I believe in the power of shared knowledge and collaboration, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any ideas, questions, or simply want to connect.
